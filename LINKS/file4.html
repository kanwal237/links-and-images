    <h2 id="123">Formation of Sentences in English</h2>
    <p>When constructing sentences, you have to follow a particular word order. They consist of words, phrases and clauses that have to be arranged sequentially in order to make sense. In most cases, the subject with or without the determiner comes first, followed by the verb.

        Let us look at the parts and components of a sentence and understand further how sentences are formed.</p>
        <h2 id="456">Parts of a Sentence</h2>
        <p >The basic division of sentences is in terms of,

            Subjects – A noun, noun phrase or pronoun that does the action mentioned in the sentence. It mostly occurs at the beginning of the sentence.
            Predicates – The remaining part of the sentence. It begins with the verb.
            Here are a few examples . <br>
            <b>Example 1:</b> Daisy teaches English.

Subject – Daisy

Predicate – Teaches English <br>

<b>Example 2:</b> Anitha called me yesterday.

Subject – Anitha

Predicate – Called me yesterday <br>

<b>Example 3:</b> The girl wearing the yellow dress is my new neighbour.

Subject – The girl wearing the yellow dress

Predicate – Is my new neighbour
        </p>
        <h2 id="789">Components of a Sentence</h2>
        <p>There are five components that can make up a sentence. They are, <br>

            Subject – The doer of the action <br>
            Verb – The action in the sentence <br>
            Object – The receiver of the action <br>
            Complement -A word/phrase that modifies the subject or object in the sentence <br>
            Adjunct – An adverb or an adverb clause that provides us with more information about the verb, complement or another adjunct in the sentence <br>
            While most sentences contain a subject and a verb, there are sentences that start with a verb.</p>
